# ðŸš€ AI-Powered Customer Support Ticket Processing System

## Overview
This project is an **AI-driven system** that automates customer support ticket processing by:
- **Classifying tickets** (Technical, Billing, Feature, Access)
- **Assigning priority** (based on urgency, sentiment, and business impact)
- **Detecting customer sentiment**
- **Suggesting follow-ups & escalation actions**
- **Generating AI-powered responses**

The system is designed to be modular, testable, and scalable.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-github-repo-url>
   cd ai-ticket-processing
Create a Virtual Environment and Activate It:

python -m venv venv
# On Unix/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Ticket Processor:

python -m src.processor
Run Tests:

python -m src.tests.test_ticket_analysis
python -m src.tests.test_response
Design Decisions
Modular Architecture:
The project is divided into separate agents:

TicketAnalysisAgent: Analyzes ticket content, categorizes tickets, and assigns priorities.
ResponseAgent: Generates customized responses using predefined templates.
TicketProcessor: Orchestrates the workflow by integrating the analysis and response agents.
BulkOrchestrator: (Optional) Processes multiple tickets from a JSON file.
Asynchronous Processing:
The use of asyncio enables non-blocking, efficient ticket processing.

Data-Driven Responses:
Response templates are stored in a JSON file, making it easy to update and extend responses without changing code.

Testing & Documentation:
Each module includes unit tests and comprehensive docstrings for maintainability and ease of debugging.

Testing Approach
Unit Tests:

test_ticket_analysis.py validates the functionality of the TicketAnalysisAgent.
test_response.py validates the functionality of the ResponseAgent.
Edge Cases:
The tests cover various scenarios such as high priority, negative sentiment, ambiguous requests, and follow-up requirements.

Bulk Testing:
The BulkOrchestrator (if used) processes multiple tickets to ensure end-to-end workflow integrity.

Manual Verification:
Running processor.py processes a sample ticket and prints out analysis and response for manual review.

Future Enhancements
Multi-Language Support:
Integrate translation APIs (e.g., Google Translate) to support multiple languages.
REST API Integration:
Expose functionality via API endpoints using FastAPI or Flask.
UI Dashboard:
Develop a frontend for real-time ticket monitoring and management.
Database Storage:
Store ticket history and responses in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
